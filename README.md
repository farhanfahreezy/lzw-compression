The LZW Compression Web App is a full-stack application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack. It provides a user-friendly interface to compress and decompress strings using the LZW algorithm.

## Description

Let's walk through the flow of the LZW compression algorithm from the frontend to the backend, including storing the results in MongoDB and sending the response back to the frontend:

1. `Input from Frontend`: The user enters a string to be compressed or decompressed in the frontend user interface.

2. `Sending String to Backend`: The frontend sends the input string to the backend server using an HTTP POST request.

3. `LZW Compression or Decompression`: The backend receives the input string and applies the LZW compression or decompression algorithm accordingly, based on the user's request.

4. `Storing Answer in MongoDB Database`: Once the compression or decompression process is complete, the backend stores the original input string, the compressed or decompressed value, and any other relevant information in the MongoDB database.

5. `Sending Response to Frontend`: After storing the results, the backend sends a response back to the frontend. The response contains the compressed or decompressed value generated by the LZW algorithm.

## Features

- `String Compression`: Compress input strings using the LZW algorithm.
- `String Decompression`: Decompress LZW-encoded strings to recover the original data.
- `History`: Browse and review previously compressed or decompressed strings.

## Installation
